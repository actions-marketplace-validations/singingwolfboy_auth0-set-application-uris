# Set Application URIs for Auth0

This [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) allows you to
add or remove application URIs from an [Auth0](https://auth0.com)
application. It's perfect for integrating pull request deployments
with Auth0, so that you can seamlessly review pull requests without
manually changing settings in Auth0.
